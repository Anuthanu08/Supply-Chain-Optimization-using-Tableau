### Project Overview
Efficient supply chain management is essential to minimize waste, optimize stock levels, and forecast demand. This project leverages SQL, Python, and Tableau to analyze inventory data, predict demand, and optimize reorder points using statistical modeling and machine learning.

🚀 Key Features
✅ SQL-based data extraction from inventory & sales databases.
✅ Data cleaning & transformation using Python (Pandas, NumPy).
✅ Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA) to predict future demand.
✅ Inventory Optimization (EOQ, Regression) to minimize costs.
✅ Interactive Tableau Dashboard for visualization insights.

📊 Technologies & Tools used
Programming: Python 🐍, SQL
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, StatsModels, Scikit-Learn
Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL
Visualization: Tableau 📈
Version Control: Git & GitHub
